# Face-tracking-with-Anime-characters
Python project where YURI from the game doki doki literature club accesses the webcam and stares directly into the players soul. Hope you enjoy!

Requirements:
  Have python3 installed. (Have used Python3.6 on python IDLE )
  install OpenCV, os, math, ctypes, time, pygame (you will probably only need to download OpenCV and Pygame)
  sudo pip install pygame opencv-python
  
Edit yuriblush.py or "YURI FULLSCREEN.py" and change the screen resolution (in pixels) in the variables scl (width) and scb (height).
Run the code and have fun with your waifu ... weeb

Make your own:

you will need only 2 images
1) character without eyes
![yuriwoeyes](yuri2.bmp)
2) eyes
![eyes](eyes.png)
 just use those images instead and you are good to go!

<h1>Version 2: Yuri now has proximity (yuriblush.py) </h1>
<p>
  If you move your face close to the webcam, she blushes!
  <br>
  The process is the same as above, change the screen resolution (in pixels) in the variables scl (width) and scb (height)
